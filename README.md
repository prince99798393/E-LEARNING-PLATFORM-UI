*DESCRIPTION*:  
The E-Learning Platform UI is a front-end design for an educational platform that offers course listing, progress tracking, and video tutorials. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project provides a clean and modern interface for users to explore and enroll in courses. The goal of the project is to make learning accessible and engaging through an intuitive design.

The course listing section displays available courses as cards, each with a brief description and an enroll button. Upon enrolling, the userâ€™s progress is tracked and displayed in a dedicated progress section. This real-time progress tracking feature ensures users stay motivated and informed about their learning journey. The video tutorials section embeds educational videos, allowing users to learn directly from the platform.

The UI is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices. The color scheme and typography are chosen to make the platform inviting and professional. The JavaScript functionality makes the platform interactive, such as dynamically updating progress and handling user actions like course enrollment. This project demonstrates how an effective UI design can enhance the user experience of an educational platform.
